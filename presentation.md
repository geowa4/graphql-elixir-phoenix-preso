# [fit] GraphQL in Phoenix

---

# GraphQL

- API query language
- Runtime for fullfilling those queries

^ This yields a complete and understandable description of your data; ask for data like `select a, b from c`; enables powerful tooling.

---

# What does that mean?

- REST replacement
- Typed
- Documentation is inseparable from the API
- GraphiQL

---

# Practically, what does that mean?

- Get all the data for the page in one query and no more than you asked for
- JSON API tells you how to navigate subelements (*_url)
- No more optional `fields` parameter
- Fewer calls & less data

---

# Let's see it.

[Star Wars API](http://graphql-swapi.parseapp.com/)

---

# Maybe something real?

[GitHub](https://graphql-explorer.githubapp.com/)

^ GitHub is switching its API to GraphQL.

# End
